# **Contributing to cvequery**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **cvequery** project! I truly appreciate the enthusiasm and the desire to help improve the tool.

However, at this time, I am unable to accept pull requests or contributions to this project. As a solo maintainer working on this project in my free time, I currently do not have the resources or bandwidth to manage external contributions effectively. I hope you understand that this decision is not a reflection of the quality of your contributions but simply a result of time constraints.

That being said, **feedback and suggestions** are always welcome! If you have ideas on how the tool could be improved or if you encounter issues, feel free to reach out to me through any of the following channels:

Please note that while I might not be able to immediately respond, I do my best to review messages when I can and will consider feedback for future updates to the tool.

Thank you again for your understanding and support! I hope you find **CVE-Query** useful, and I encourage you to continue exploring and using the tool.
